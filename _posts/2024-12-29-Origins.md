## The Beginning 

Refer to the embedded video below. How can one not create this Batman blog upon seeing that line of dialogue. If not me, someone else surely would have taken up the task!

The lines from <r>Robin</r> that started it all. For context, the lines comes after Robin questions Bruce Wayne after he founds out Lucious Fox knows Batman's secret identity. 
> So who else knows?
> 
> Is there a list or something?
> 
> Is it on the internet?
> 
> <r>BruceWayneIsBatman.org</r>

The clip comes from The Batman (2007) episode, S04.E12. [The Joining (Part 1)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0856357/). In this episode, mysterious events are underfoot where unbeknownst to Batman, Wayne industries is building something seemingly devious. It is up to the world's greatest detective and his two sidekicks, Batgirl and Robin, to uncover this mystery. As the mystery unfolds, Batman gets help from a stranger, John Jones who is new to the Gotham PD. A stranger who seems to knows Batman is Bruce Wayne. Maybe it is on the internet haha. Towards the end of the episode, we find out what the true identity of John Jones is. It should be of no suprise to DC fans. It's Martian Manhunter of course. The alien from Mars whose entire civilization was destroyed by the Joining. He has come to Earth to prevent the same thing that happened to Earth. The introduction to Martian Manhunger is similar in the first Justice League (2001) episode S01E01: [Secret Origins](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0618170/). After Earth's first encounter with the Joining, the Justice League is formed in both The Batman (2007) S04.E12 as well as in the Justice League (2001) S01.E01.

Very similar designs for Martian Manhunter between both TV series. Though I think the version from The Batman seems more serious and more sure of himself.
