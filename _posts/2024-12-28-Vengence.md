## Timeshare

This image comes from the Justice League Action episode [Time Share S01E09 (2017)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6323312/?ref_=ttep_ep9).

In this episode, Batman goes back in time (to Batman's first night out, maybe 90's) to stop Chronos from defeating him.

The gif is actually a lightning pose of the early Batman. His first pose as the dark knight. 
Even comes with the iconic quote, "I am Vengence. I am the night. I am Batman".

Apparently, even the blue beetle himself gets to try out this Iconic Pose. Though it is interesting to note, that in the blue beetle's version, the lightning is coming from opposite direction compared to batman's.

## The OG

I believe the first sighting of this lightning pose was in Batman the Animated Series's intro. [In case you need the link](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103359/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_in_0_q_batman%2520the%2520ani)
