## Timeshare

This image comes from the Justice League Action episode [Time Share S01E09 (2017)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6323312/?ref_=ttep_ep9).

In this episode, Batman goes back in time (to Batman's first night out, maybe 90's) to stop Chronos from defeating him.

The gif is actually a lightning pose of the early Batman. His first pose as the dark knight. 
Even comes with the iconic quote, "I am Vengence. I am the night. I am Batman".

Apparently, even the blue beetle himself gets to try out this Iconic Pose. If you were interested in more information regarding this episode, I found the [justice league wiki](https://justice-league-action.fandom.com/wiki/Time_Share) to be helpful.

## The OG

I believe the first sighting of this lightning pose was in Batman the Animated Series's intro. [In case you need the link](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103359/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_8_nm_0_in_0_q_batman%2520the%2520ani)

## Bat Mite

Even Bat Mite couldn't resist the posing fun! [From Batman The Brave and the Bold S01E19: Legends of the Dark Mite.](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1432347/)

# The OG Quote

I am Vengence. I am the night. I am Batman. This was first heard in Batman the Animated Series episode: Nothing to fear. [See youtube clip] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xbbpH-20ak&ab_channel=BatmanAnimatedVideos). Though apparently there was much to be feared. In this episode, fueled by Scarecrow toxin, Batman must face his own fears. Specifaclly, the fear that his parents would have never approved of what he has become.

In this episode, Batman is in quite the vunerable position when he says the iconic lines. A far cry from the position of strength in which he says it in the Timeshare episode.
