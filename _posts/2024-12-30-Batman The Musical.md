## Mayhem of the Music Meister

In Batman the Brave and the Bold, Episode 25 we are treated with a gem of an episode. A Batman musical with Neil Patrick Harris as the top bill playing the music Meister. 

The ending is even a sweet one with Black Canary getting together with Green Arrow as they also did in the Justice League TV series (2001-2004).
