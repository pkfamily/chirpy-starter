## Mayhem of the Music Meister

In Batman the Brave and the Bold [Season 1 Episode 25](https://braveandbold.fandom.com/wiki/Mayhem_of_the_Music_Meister!), we are treated with a gem of an episode. A Batman musical with Neil Patrick Harris as the top bill playing the villain Music Meister, a drama enthusiast who found that his singing voice puts others under his spell. This is not merely a cameo either, Music Meister gets the most lines in this episode. [It's truly is a beautiful thing.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5vKwcz820s&ab_channel=DCKids) I also love how the entire pace of the episode moves to the speed one would expect from a typical musical. All of the characters even dance as though they are in a musical number. Well, I suppose they are in one! It all fits very well within the context of the show as the Music Meister puts all within singing distance in a hypnotic trance; a musical hypno trance. Luckily, Batman is not so easily hypnotized. 

Batman teams up with Black Canary whose voice and allure captures the hearts of the main villain Music Meister and fellow super hero, Green Arrow. As things would have it, Black Canary only has eyes for Batman. Though Batman never takes time off from fighting crime. A typical love triangle has formed so naturally, a trope one so common with musicals.

In the end, everything is wrapped up in nice a package. Batman defeats Music Meister with his wonderful voice. [Flashbacks to Justice League Unlimited S01E05 where he sings in exchange for help from Circe.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nim7DEns2A&ab_channel=DC) And Black Canary and Green Arrow get a duet where they end up together as they also did in the Justice League TV series (2001-2004). Gotta love these references whether intentional or not! Also have to give additional respect to the music composer: Michael McCuiston and lyric composer: James Tucker for their work on the track: "I'm the Music Meister". According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayhem_of_the_Music_Meister!), the musical numbers was noted to take inspiration from West Side Story and The Phantom of the Opera. 

The fun doesn't stop there! Given how amazing this episode was (An Emmy Nomination no less). An eight track soundtrack of the music from the episode was even released! I don't know about you, but "I'm the Music Meister" is certainly going to be added to my Spotify playlist.
